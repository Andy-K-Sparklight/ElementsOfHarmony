# Elements of Harmony
This is a **Minecraft MOD**.  
With adding six elements to Minecraft, you can use them to build **more powerful** tools or weapons.  
These elements can be find in the form of **minerals**, **smelt** them to get other form of these elements.  
There can **never** be too many elements, if you own enough of them, you can even use them to **transcend life and death!**  
These elements can hurt mobs **effectively**, hold one on your left hand to disperse mobs!  
At last, find **The Tree of Harmony**, to learn about why, you, Steve or Alex, are here, in this world.  
Is this the end? Or **just a beginning**?

Okay, and that's the whole absurd story. Anyway, we just want to develop a mod related with **My Little Pony(R)**. (For the author, me, is a **brony**, obviously)  

This MOD is **still developing** and is compatible with **Minecraft 1.15.2** and **Forge 31.1.0** when developing.  

**DO NOT** star or fork this repo on **GitHub**, cause this will put a lot of pressure on us(I'm serious).  

If you are looking for another MOD related with **My Little Pony(R)**, try these two:
- [Mine Little Pony](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/MineLittlePony) by [Mine Little Pony](https://github.com/MineLittlePony), a **Fabric MOD**. (I tried it, really **Superduper AWESOME**!)
- [Love and Tolerance](https://github.com/Love-and-Tolerance/Love-and-Tolerance) by [Love and Tolerance](https://github.com/Love-and-Tolerance), a **material package**. (**Also pretty!**)

At the beginning, we had considered to use **Fabric** to be compatible with **Mine Little Pony**, but, after we read the documentation, we decided to give up, stay foolish, and just use **Forge**.
